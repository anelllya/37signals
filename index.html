                        I find great joy in creating something from nothing. Whenever I face a creative challenge, I dive into exploration, testing possibilities and narrowing the scope to arrive at the strongest solution. I'm relentless when it comes to achieving any goal I set my sights on. I love geeking out over new styles, emerging trends, and fresh takes on old ones. Above all, I love exploring, building, and shipping things.

                        I studied Industrial Design, but I started learning HTML and CSS back in 2010, right around the time current web standards were taking shape. Little by little, I found myself falling for the web. Over time, I picked up more CSS and HTML, then SASS, and kept building on what I knew. It felt good. Before long, I was defining websites at work, gaining experience, and loving the results I could create. I've been working on the web ever since. And I created this HTML letter just for you.

It felt like a real innovation back then, even though now it's pretty much the norm.</li>

What I love about it is how naturally the interface aligns with my own way of thinking. I get it instantly, I see everything at a glance, and honestly, that makes me really happy.</li>

                <h2>Dear 37signals Team,</h2>

                <p>I've been waiting <span id="years"> nearly a decade </span> for this position to open up. Just the possibility for me to join 37signals feels a bit surreal, not just because of the products you are building, but because of the way you're building them.</p>

                <p>The way 37signals approaches product development is exactly how I've always wanted to work. It would be an honor to contribute, learn, and grow with your team.</p>

                <p>With more than 15 years in web and interface design, I've crafted experiences that are simple, scalable, and human. But this isn't just about skills, it's about alignment. I believe in async work, in small, powerful teams, and in building software that respects people's time and attention. That's exactly why I'm here.</p>

                <p>Ironically - or maybe fatefully - I once worked at a company called System73. Another beautiful prime number. Another team driven by product excellence. It feels like my path is leading me toward 37signals, and I'm ready for it.</p>

                <p>If you're looking for someone who's been quietly preparing for this moment, someone who truly gets what it means to work like you do, I'm here.</p>
